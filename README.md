# Context
Every four years, FIFA celebrates the FIFA World Cup for men's senior teams. It's a highly anticipated event that captures the attention of people worldwide. This year, the World Cup is being held in Qatar. To learn more about the Qatar 2022 World Cup, visit https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022.

A popular tradition alongside the World Cup is the "World Cup pool" played among friends and family.

The World Cup Pool
In the World Cup pool, participants predict the scores of the various scheduled football matches throughout the tournament. The goal is to accumulate the most points compared to other players based on the accuracy of your predictions. A set of rules determine how points are awarded for each match. At the end, the player with the highest total score is declared the winner.

Pool Rules
Each pool has its own rules. For this course project, the following rules will apply:

Correct Predictions:

Exact Score: A player achieves an exact score prediction for a specific match if they correctly predict the winning and losing teams (or a draw) and the exact number of goals scored by each team (including ties).
Partial Score: A player achieves a partial score prediction for a specific match if they correctly predict the winning and losing teams (or a draw) but do not correctly predict the exact number of goals scored by each team.
Scoring:

Group Stage: 2 points for exact score, 1 point for partial score.
Round of 16: 4 points for exact score, 2 points for partial score.
Quarter Finals: 8 points for exact score, 4 points for partial score.
Semi-finals and Third Place Match: 16 points for exact score, 8 points for partial score.
Final: 32 points for exact score, 16 points for partial score.
Draws:

For matches beyond the group stage, the final score will be considered the score after regulation time (90 minutes, or 120 minutes if the initial 90 minutes end in a draw).

Winner:

The winner is the player with the highest total score after all World Cup matches have been played.

Clarifications
If there are any doubts or unclear aspects of the rules, consult your course instructor.
Program Considerations
The program you develop should take these rules into account.
